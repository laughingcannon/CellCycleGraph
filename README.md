# CellCycleGraph

A Python implementation of the stages of cell division (i.e. _G1, S,_ and _G2/M_).

This program was created for a team of student biologists at the SRM Institute of Science & Technology, inspired by the paper published in The Journal of Cell Biology, by Ouenzar et al., 2017.
Paper can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317848337_Cell_cycle-dependent_spatial_segregation_of_telomerase_from_sites_of_DNA_damage "Cell cycle-dependent spatial segregation of telomerase from sites of DNA damage").

The program takes from the user the number of cells having RNA specifically in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and both, for every stage, and plots the graphs showing percentage-wise content.
