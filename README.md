# CellCycleGraph

A Python implementation of the stages of cell division (i.e. _G1, S,_ and _G2/M_).

Created for a team of student biologists, inspired by the paper published in The Journal of Cell Biology, by Ouenzar et al., 2017.
Paper can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317848337_Cell_cycle-dependent_spatial_segregation_of_telomerase_from_sites_of_DNA_damage "Cell cycle-dependent spatial segregation of telomerase from sites of DNA damage").

Takes the number of cells having RNA specifically in the nucleolus, nucleoplasm, and both, for every stage, and plots the graphs showing percentage-wise content.
